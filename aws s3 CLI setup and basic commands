In order to activate the Command Line functionality on your machine for AWS you will need to install the AWS CLI installer first:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html
from the S3 console you can get your access key in the security credentials option under your profile dopdown.
generate or use an existing access key ( you will need both the Access key and the Secret access key in order to configure the CLI on your machine).
once installed:
 - run in a Command Prompt: aws --version 
 - run: aws configure  __now you will be prompted for the access key, the secret access key, the Default region (us-east-1) and the output format (you can choose json)
once this is done you can run: aws ec2 describe-regions, just to make sure that your configuration applied properly and the CLI works


mostly used CLI commands:'
create a new bucket: aws s3 mb s3://**name_of_the_bucket**
delete a  bucket: aws s3 rb s3://**name_of_the_bucket**
copy file: aws s3 cp **file_name** s3://**bucket_name**
move file: aws s3 mv **file_name** s3://**bucket_name**
move from s3 to local directory: aws s3 mv s3://fclil/lil2.txt ./


windows create file from Command Prompt:
echo "This is file 2">>lil2.txt
